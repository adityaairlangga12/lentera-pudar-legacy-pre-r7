# Project Status — Lentera Pudar

- **Current Project Phase**: Phase 0 (Pre-Production & Toolchain Foundation).
- **Target Runtime Engine**: Unreal Engine 5 (Selected Target Runtime; Engine Project Not Initialized; Technical Implementation Architecture Not Yet Audited).
- **Target DCC Software**: Blender 5.2 LTS (Primary DCC; Blender 5.2.0 LTS executable observed available on the R4 audit host).
- **External Tooling Status**:
  - `lentera-blender-mcp`: Package Version `1.0.0`; public registry 23 tools and 17 deferred tools. R4 revalidation on 2026-08-18: contract tests `33/33 PASS`; integration tests `13/14 PASS`. `render_viewport_screenshot` is `VERIFICATION_FAILED` pending investigation in the MCP repository. Other behavior is not generalized beyond test evidence.
  - `lentera-ue5-mcp`: Maturity `NOT_STARTED`, Availability `UNAVAILABLE`, Disposition `PLANNED`. A compatibility placeholder is not server availability or tool registration.
- **Game Implementation Status**:
  - Gameplay, Narrative & Visual Design: `DOCUMENTED` (In `references/01`–`04`).
  - Unreal Engine Gameplay Systems: `NOT_STARTED` (Maturity: NOT_STARTED).
  - Production 3D & Audio Assets: `NOT_STARTED` (Specifications Documented in `references/04-art-3d/style-guide.md`).
- **Documentation Refoundation Status**:
  - R1 Information Architecture & Governance Baseline: `ACCEPTED` and implemented in the current repository baseline.
  - R2 Canonical Content Migration & Semantic Closure: `ACCEPTED`; migration and pre-R3 semantic corrections are validated in the current repository baseline.
  - R3 ADR Refoundation: `ACCEPTED`; four architecture/governance ADRs and the active ADR register have passed metadata, link, scope, and semantic validation.
  - R4 Pipeline/QC, Agents & Skills Refoundation: `ACCEPTED`; eight Domain 06 documents, nine project-local skill specifications, agent configuration status, and read-only repository validators passed metadata, link, scope, JSON, and semantic validation.
  - Documentation Refoundation R1–R4: `CLOSED`.
  - R4-C Roadmap Continuity Correction: `ACCEPTED`; this bounded governance-only correction restores the required post-R4 roadmap order.
  - R5 Legacy Contamination & Cross-Domain Consistency Audit: `ACCEPTED`; final read-only re-audit passed after bounded R5-A, R5-B, and R5-C corrections.
  - R6 Fresh Repository Genesis Preparation: `ACCEPTED`; canonical genesis manifest, safety boundary, execution procedure, and R8 verification contract are recorded in `references/00-governance/repository-genesis-plan.md`.
  - R7 Fresh `lentera-pudar` Repository Genesis: `NOT_STARTED`; `NEXT` substantive gate.
  - R8 Migration Verification & Legacy Repository Retirement Gate: `NOT_STARTED`.
  - H1 Unreal Pipeline Readiness Audit: `BLOCKED`; it must not start until R8 is externally accepted.
  - R4-C does not constitute execution or acceptance of R5–R8.
- **Blocker Registry**:
  - H1 cannot verify Unreal runtime architecture until an Unreal project and selected engine version are available for inspection.
  - Blender MCP screenshot verification is open; it blocks use of that tool as verified visual evidence but does not invalidate the completed R4 documentation refoundation.
  - Optional shell safety hook is `NOT_EXECUTED` on the R4 audit host because `bash` is unavailable; client activation remains `UNKNOWN`.
